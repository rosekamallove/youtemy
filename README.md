    (1.) Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and follow the steps to create a new Firebase project.
    (2.) Select `</>` , *Add a project via Code*.

    (3.) Create a new web app using the steps provided on the console.

    (4.) You will recieve a firebasConfig object with the first paramter as API key. Copy it, which will look something like:
     
        ```js
                cosnt firebaseConfig = {
                apiKey: "process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE",
                authDomain: "AUTH_DOMAIN",
                projectId: "PROJECT_ID",
                storageBucket: "STORAGE_BUCKET",
                messagingSenderId: "*************",
                appId: "******************************",
                measurementId: "*************"
              };
        ```

    (5.) After you get the Firebase API key, create a .env file in the root folder of the repository

    (6.) Insert the folowing snippet in the file

            REACT_APP_FIREBASE="API_KEY_HERE"

    3. Select **Youtube Data API v3**

    4. Click on Credentials to create new credentials for the API client

    5. Select API Key out of the 3 options available (API Key, OAuth Client ID, Service Key)

    6. A new API key will be generated. Copy it in the .env file.

                 REACT_APP_YOUTUBE="API_KEY_HERE"

  - Ensure that .env is added in .gitignore file.

  -  In the root folder and enter the following commands in the CLI
