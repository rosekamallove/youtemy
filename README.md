# Pre Fellowship Template

This is a template to help you get started with your projects. Find out more information inside of the Fellow Handbook.

This template has a `main` and `staging` branch already setup. 

- Code will only be merged into `main` once your Pod Leader has reviewed your code. At the end of each week, there will be a code freeze. Your Pod Leader will review it before it's merged.
- During the week, you'll merge code into `staging`.
